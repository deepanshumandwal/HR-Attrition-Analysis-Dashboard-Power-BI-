**Project Title**

HR Attrition Root Cause Analysis and Retention Dashboard (Power BI)

**Short Description/Purpose**


This project is a detailed, data-driven analysis of a company's workforce turnover, designed to identify the precise demographic, satisfaction, and compensation factors driving attrition. The goal is to surface actionable insights that allow HR and leadership to implement targeted, evidence-based retention strategies, presented through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

**Data Source**


The data was sourced from an internal database or publicly available HR datasets (e.g., Kaggle/IBM HR Analytics).

**Features and Highlights**


- _High-Risk Education Field Identified:_ Revealed that 38% of the total attrition count came from employees who pursued "Life Sciences" education, followed by those in "Medical." These two fields alone accounted for approximately 63% of the total company attrition.

- _Clear Job Satisfaction Failure:_ Identified a critical issue where the majority of employees leaving the Research & Development department had given the lowest possible Job Satisfaction score of '1' out of '4' prior to their departure.

- _Compensation as a Key Driver:_ Showcased a direct link between low compensation and low satisfaction, as the major attrition occurred among employees earning up to $5,000 (approximately 23% lower than the company's average salary). This directly supports the low satisfaction scores (level 1) observed.

- _Experience and Tenure Vulnerability:_ Highlighted an immediate retention challenge with a significant majority of employees leaving the company after only 1 year of service.

- _Peak Attrition Age Group:_ Identified the 26-35 years age group as the most vulnerable segment experiencing the highest attrition count.

**Charts and Graphs Used**


- _Donut Chart (Attrition by Education Field):_ Used to clearly visualize the proportional distribution of attrition, immediately highlighting the disproportionate impact of "Life Sciences" (38%) and "Medical" fields.

- _Table Matrix (Attrition by Job Satisfaction & Department):_ Employed to drill down into the relationship between satisfaction scores and department, providing the definitive insight that most of the attrited employees from R&D rated their satisfaction as '1'.

- _Stacked Bar Chart (Attrition by Salary Basis):_ Chosen to graphically correlate attrition count with salary brackets, vividly demonstrating the high turnover among employees earning up to $5K.

- _Stacked Bar Chart (Attrition by Age Group):_ Used to identify the high-risk demographic segment, clearly showing peak attrition in the 26-35 years age group.

- _Area Chart (Attrition by Years Worked):_ Selected for its effectiveness in visualizing tenure trends, dramatically illustrating the spike in attrition after 1 year of employment.

**Business Problem Solved**


The project solved the urgent business need for a granular understanding of workforce instability, which was previously a hidden cost. By uncovering that **63%** of attrition is concentrated in just two education fields (Life Sciences and Medical) and that this turnover is strongly correlated with low salary (up to $5K, **23% below average**) and minimum job satisfaction (score of 1), the dashboard provides a clear mandate for action. Specifically, it empowers leadership to implement targeted salary reviews for low-paid, high-attrition roles and to focus immediate retention efforts on employees between the ages of 26-35 who have completed only one year of service.
